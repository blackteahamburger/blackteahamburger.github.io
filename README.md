I am an [ArchWiki Maintainer](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/ArchWiki:Maintenance_Team).

I currently have only two projects on GitHub:

- [Arch Linux installation script](https://github.com/blackteahamburger/My-archlinux-installation-script)
- [Arch Linux configuration tutorial](https://github.com/blackteahamburger/My-archlinux-configuration)

I will add more items in the future, so stay tuned.
